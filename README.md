## Parametric Statistical Models
This repository contains analytical exercises on the practical application of parametric statistical models in the R programming language. Each exercise is saved as an R Markdown document.

### Analysis methods included
- linear models
- generalized linear models
- logit and probit models

## Used technology
- [R version 4.1.3](https://cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-4/)
- [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/)

## Used libraries
```r
library("car")
library("ggplot2")
library("lmtest")
library("pscl")
library("pROC")
```

## How to view?
The preferred preview file is `.html`, but GitHub does not support previewing these files, so a simplified `.md` file is also included. Each folder in the repository has a `README.md` file containing a simplified preview of each analysis so that they are visible immediately after opening the folder. Unfortunately, interactive features are not visible in the `.md` preview. To view the full interactive R Markdown document, download the `.html` file.
