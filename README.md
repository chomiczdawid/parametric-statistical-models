## Parametric Statistical Models
This repository contains analytical exercises on the practical application of parametric statistical models in the R programming language. Each exercise is saved as an R Markdown document.

### Analysis methods included
- linear models
- generalized linear models
- logit models (in progress)

## Used technology
- [R version 4.1.3](https://cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-4/)
- [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/)

## Used libraries
```r
library("car")
library("ggplot2")
library("lmtest")
```

## How to view?
The preferred preview file is .html, but GitHub does not support previewing these files, so a simplified .md file is also included. Unfortunately, interactive menu and mathematical equations are not visible in the .md preview. To view the full interactive R Markdown document, download the .html file.
